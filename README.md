Solutions to CSES Problem Set

Here is the link to the [CSES problem set site](https://cses.fi/problemset/)

Notes:
- **Graph Problems**:
    1. *Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph* => DS: Adj list, Algo: BFS(with distance and predecessor track)

    2. *Min. edges to make graph connected* => No. of connected components - 1

    3. *Bipartite check* => DS: Adj list, Algo: BFS(graph coloring with 2-colors)
